I have undervolted both cpu and gpu, repasted with thermal grizzly kryonaut, padded the vrm using the bridge method. I ran various benchmarks and I am happy with what I got.

Download and report The benchmark estimates assume a 5Ghz clock for the i7 and i5, and a 4Ghz clock for the R7 and R5. But, because they're estimates allow a 2 or 3% margin of error. How did I estimate? Well I know that (A) single-threaded performance wasn't going to change just like it didn't from Sky to Kaby, and (B) Coffee wasn't going to overclock higher than a 7700K's 5Ghz average since the 7700Ks can already push 5.3Ghz if you're lucky or have the substrate of X299, and the 8700K has more cores Corona FPS Benchmark.
